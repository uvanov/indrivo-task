# INDRIVO Task

Well, that was funny. I work last time with Vanilla JS about a few months ago) 

[ **findBestMatch** function placed in "app.js", tabs functionality into "tabs.js" ]

### Some comments from me:
    1. I decided to make elements from "radio-system" without BEM-classnames. I think it doesn't require it.
    2. I know that placing block-element inside <label> it's not a good idea, but in usual cases we use JS for a systems like this, right?)
    
    
That's all, have a nice day
